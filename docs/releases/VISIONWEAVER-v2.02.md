# VisionWeaver v2.02 implementation checkpoint

Date: 2026-10-02. User authorized implementation with the existing version plus .02. Production design v2 becomes v2.02; the Studio health contract retains its existing 7 baseline as 7.02. Supabase deployment revisions are independent counters.

## Implemented
- Library Refresh has busy, completion, item-count and error feedback; existing Library card layout retained.
- Reference carousel includes uploaded and generated images.
- Cast: retrieve/edit/use saved avatars, bottom Save action, voice profile, optimistic version checks and owner-scoped lookup/uniqueness.
- Scenes: save immutable scene setup revisions including place/date/time, terrain, weather, light, camera, action, ending state and eight visual/audio environment plans.
- Create resolves owned avatar/scene records on the server and stores snapshots with each generation. Reference ordering is preserved; excessive combined direction is rejected rather than silently truncated.
- Continue from ending: authenticated extraction of the full clip's final frame and last two seconds, durable storage and lineage. The next image-to-video request receives the ending image; motion tail is retained for review, not passed to a model that cannot accept it.

## Verification
42 tests passed, TypeScript and Vite production build passed locally. GitHub Quality Gate36974985347 passed for e1621bb9390c6abdae9d77c48e436c71d7edff10; Vercel production deployment dpl_Cow2MVPt54ZcPsdZC6auNLcnUAww is READY for that same commit. Backend deployed as Supabase revision25. Owner identity migration applied without deleting rows. Local continuation endpoint rejects missing authentication (401) and malformed IDs (400). The deployed continuation and assembly endpoints returned HTTP200 with binary_ready=true at 2026-10-02T06:45:43Z. The continuation endpoint rejects unauthenticated POST with HTTP401. A synthetic three-second blue-to-red video verified that the extraction algorithm returns the red final scene (RGB253,0,0), not the blue opening. This does not substitute for an authenticated extraction of the user's video. The browser reaches the ordinary email sign-in screen; no authenticated end-to-end proof yet.

## Open acceptance gates
1. Fresh signed-in session: save/reload/edit avatar and voice; stale edits fail; owner isolation holds.
2. Save/reload/use scene and verify generation snapshots and actual visual results.
3. Completed owned video: extract ending frame/tail, inspect media, retry without repeating provider generation, continue a new shot.
4. Library refresh and carousel visual checks on desktop/mobile.
5. No production certification until evidence above exists.

## Full proposal scope remains open
The 30-part design is not complete merely because this foundation is deployed. Voice synthesis/lip sync, independently generated sound stems and layered editing, trimmed-timeline endings, motion-aware continuation, physical simulation, automated location/date/species validation, pigmentation/temporal QC, 4K delivery provenance, market research/book editorial and publication receipts, and bounded autonomous execution still require implementation and acceptance evidence. No 16K/native-resolution or physically validated result is claimed. No paid render or publication was started by this checkpoint.
